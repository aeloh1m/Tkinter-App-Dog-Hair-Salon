## General Information
-  An insight: <br />
    - For the present project, the requirements were to create an app for managing data from a business, this case business was a hair saloon for dogs and it's staff.

- How did we proceeded? <br />
    - We had to investigate more about tkinter and CRUD processes in order to make this app. We made this app using a defined tiny piece of code that we've been given in the lectures, to furthermore mix it with our code and results of our investigation on how to use the visual library **tkinter**.

- What is the purpose of this project? <br />
    - The purpose of this project is to be able to manage the dogs and staff for a pet's hair saloon, and to show what we achieved to our professors.
    
## Usage
In this stage of the program, all you should do is, with your preferred text editor, open the index.py and execute it
previously having installed Python and tkinter (for the last one, you can do so with "pip install tk"!).
